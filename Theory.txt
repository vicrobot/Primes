Firstly i have the list of roots and recursions..(Appended as queue) Let list be Root
Now find the primes till Root[0] then use those primes to find the primes till Root[2] then use those primes to find primes till Root[3] ...

def genp3(n):
    for i in range(2, n):
        var1 = True
        for j in primes:
            if j>= i: continue
            else:
                if i%j==0:
                    var1 = 0
                    break
        if var1: yield i

primes = set([2,3])

for i in Root+[{1}]:
     primes.update(set(genp3(i)))
     
    
Seeing this part; and knowing that membership checking is fast; we can use other method of prime sieve.

The primes can have skips like if one prime occured; we can skip next i .

There is something called Sundaram's sieve.
