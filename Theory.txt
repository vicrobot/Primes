The primes can have skips like if one prime occured; we can skip next i .

There is something called Sundaram's sieve.
The fact goes like this:- 

For 1<= i <= j; (i,j) belonging to n; (2i+1)(2j+1) is not a prime or say eq. of non primes; and all numbers which can satisfy this eq; is non-prime.
Now (2i+1)(2j+1) =  2i + 2j + 4ij + 1 = 2(i + j + 2ij) + 1 which tells that odds made by all numbers except numbers satisfying this eq i + j + 2ij will make odds that would ne non non primes that is primes(except 2).

# HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS THAT ANYTHING * 10 IS VERY PATTERNIC IN NUMBERS. IS THERE ANY DEEP REASON? CAN WE MAKE OUR NUMBER SYSTEM WRITING MORE RELATED TO VALUES?
